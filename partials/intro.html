    <strong>Senior web developer with a passion for improving both end-user and developer
        experience.</strong> With 13+ years of expertise across multiple frameworks and languages, I have developed a
    strong belief that code should be readable above (almost) all else. Simple solutions to complex problems are
    generally best.
