    <strong>Senior web developer with a passion for improving both the user experience as well as the developer experience.</strong> With 12 years of expertise across multiple frameworks and languages, I’ve developed a strong belief that code should be readable above (almost) all else. I’ve done some backend work but frontend development (javascript, HTML and CSS plus any associated tooling/patterns/best practices) is what excites me the most!
