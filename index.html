                <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Until mid 2012, it was believed that responsive sites were not an
                    option in the MemberClicks system because of minimum width limitations in the members' only section.
                    I developed a solution for this issue and created several responsive templated options. However,
                    because of the price points of the design services offered by MemberClicks, responsive sites were
                    not an option for Custom sites. The lone exception is the Missouri Pharmacy Association site, which
                    I 'responsive-ized' in late 2014 before moving to the engineering team.</p>
                <p>Also, MemberClicks' business model regarding design was to create the template and then turn the CMS
                    back over to the client. They can then populate it with any content they prefer. Which sometimes
                    means red or blue or yellow bold text so please don't hold that against me if you see any. (And if
                    you notice any site like that, a heads up would be greatly appreciated so I can remove it from my
                    portfolio.)</p>

                        This project required that 2 different types of events be displayed on the map while also
                        allowing the results to be filtered by date and event type. Additionaly, a sidebar was necessary
                        to display all the events within the filtered range. The map points would open a detail modal
                        and events within a given distance would need to be combined.

                        This project mapped several different locations and included a detail modal. Each location
                        consists of several operators that are populated into a list below the map and must update when
                        the map point is clicked.
