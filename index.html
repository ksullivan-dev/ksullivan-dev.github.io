                 <h2>Intro</h2>
                 <p>I decided to put this together to show <strong>and</strong> tell about my professional abilites.  It was written completely by hand, using little more than a text editor with StackOverflow and reference docs at the ready.  The stylesheet is written in Sass using the Bourbon library and Bourbon's Neat framework.  I also used the command line to compile the sass files and used GitHub for version control.  Finally, I set up my local environment using Vagrant.  The javascript is written by hand, and while I used several sites as inspiration/troubleshooting, everything has been customized by me to fit my needs.</p>
                 <p>I'm a web developer with a passion for improving the user's experience.  I'm fluent in HTML and CSS, prefer semantic markup and can work well as an individual or part of a team.  I've actually never used Bootstrap or Foundation CSS frameworks because I feel like it can often add unnecessary bloat to a project and can often muddy the markup.  While those frameworks can allow for rapid development, I prefer to write my own so that I have more control over the output without having to overwrite a framework's styles.</p>
                 <p>I've divided this resume into six parts: <strong>Intro, Relevant Experience, Other Jobs, Portfolio, Education and Contact</strong>.  I hope this works to sell you on me. And if you have any questions, please let me know.</p>

                     <h3>MemberClicks &raquo; <span class="sub-head">Atlanta, GA <br />October 2011 - November 2015</span></h3>
                     <p>MemberClicks provides membership management software focused on small staff associations.  The software includes a front-end website for association members and administrative portal for association staff.  For the most part, the engineering team focuses on the admin site and the design team handles front-end requests.  I've worked on both sides.  We serve roughly 1500 clients and I've probably worked on 15-30% of the front-end websites of those clients in my 3+ years on the design team.  I started on the engineering team in January and have worked on several features on the admin side that affect all clients.</p>
                     <p>Both with MemberClicks and in other positions, the timelines overlap because one job didn't necessarily end when the next one started.  With MemberClicks, there are several periods of overlap and the dates are approximate.  Also, the only 'official' titles that I've had at MemberClicks are Web Content Quality Assurance contractor, Maximization Specialist and Associate Software Engineer.  However, because I wore many hats, I tried to group the descriptions together.</p>

                 <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                 <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Until mid 2012, it was believed that responsive sites were not an option in the MemberClicks system because of minimum width limitations in the members' only section.  I developed a solution for this issue and created several responsive templated options.  However, because of the price points of the design services offered by MemberClicks, responsive sites were not an option for Custom sites or Site Matches.  The lone exception is the Missouri Pharmacy Association site, which I 'responsive-ized' in late 2014 before moving to the engineering team.</p>
                 <p>Also, MemberClicks' business model regarding design was to create the template and then turn the CMS back over to the client.  They can then populate it with any content they prefer.  Which sometimes means red or blue or yellow bold text so please don't hold that against me if you see any.  (And if you notice any site like that, a heads up would be greatly appreciated so I can remove it from my portfolio.)</p>

                         This project required that 2 different types of events be displayed on the map while also allowing the results to be filtered by date and event type.
