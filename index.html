            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
              I am a seasoned web developer with a passion for improving the
              user's experience and over 10 years of professional expertise. I
              have dabbled in backend work but I prefer working with javascript,
              HTML and CSS on the front end. I have spent most of the last three
              years developing in React and it is my go-to tool for developing
              dynamic frontends.
