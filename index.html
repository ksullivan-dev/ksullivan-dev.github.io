                 <h2>Intro</h2>
                 <p><strong>This resume is in beta*.</strong>  I decided to put this together to show <strong>and</strong> tell about my professional abilites.  It was written completely by hand, using little more than a text editor <span class="inside-thought">(Atom)</span> with <span class="inside-thought">(lots of)</span> StackOverflow and reference docs at the ready.  The stylesheet is written in Sass using the Bourbon library and Bourbon's Neat framework.  It is compiled with Grunt.  The javascript is written by hand, and while I used several sites as inspiration/troubleshooting, everything has been customized by me to fit my needs.</p>
                 <p>I'm a web developer with a passion for improving the user's experience.  I'm fluent in HTML and CSS, prefer semantic markup and can work well as an individual or part of a team.  I've actually never used Bootstrap or Foundation CSS frameworks because I feel like it can often add unnecessary bloat to a project and can often muddy the markup.  While those frameworks can allow for rapid development, I prefer to write my own so that I have more control over the output without having to overwrite a framework's styles.</p>
                 <p>I've divided this resume into four parts: <strong>Intro, Relevant Experience, Other Jobs, and Contact</strong>.  I hope this works to sell you on me. And if you have any questions, please let me know.</p>
                 <p class="inside-thought">*I mention that this resume is in beta for a few reasons.  I've tested it across multiple desktop browsers and mobile devices and it generally performs well but is not without its bugs.  If you find them, please forgive me.  If you don't, you should definitely hire me!</p>

                 <h2>Relevant Experience</h2>
                 <div class="job-container">
                     <h3>MemberClicks &raquo; <span class="sub-head">Atlanta, GA <br />October 2011 - present</span></h3>
                     <p>MemberClicks provides membership management software focused on small staff associations.  The software includes a front-end website for association members and administrative portal for association staff.  For the most part, the engineering team focuses on the admin site and the design team handles front-end requests.  I've worked on both sides.  We serve roughly 1500 clients and I've probably worked on 30-50% of the front-end websites of those clients in my 3+ years on the design team.  I've been on the engineering team since January and have worked on several features on the admin side that affect all clients.</p>
                     <p>Both with MemberClicks and in other positions, the timelines overlap because one job didn't necessarily end when the next one started.  With MemberClicks, there are several periods of overlap and the dates are approximate.  Also, the only 'official' titles that I've had are Web Content Quality Assurance contractor, Maximization Specialist and Associate Software Engineer.  However, because I wore many hats, I tried to group the descriptions together.</p>
